## General Information
-  Similar to most other lending companies,not lending loans and lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants are the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.The dataset that was referred to is "Loan Data Set" and "Data Dictionary" where in while one contains the data across rows and columns the other describes the data for further analysis.
