## General Information
  Similar to most other lending companies,not lending loans and lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants are the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.The dataset that was referred to is "Loan Data Set" and "Data Dictionary" where in while one contains the data across rows and columns the other describes the data for further analysis.

## Conclusions
 Based on our observations made from the dataset we have observed that the following parameters might be one of the factors to be considered for identifying loan defaults.
- Loans provided on high interest rate are more prone to defaulter.
- Loans provided on longer term (60 months) and high loan value  with high interest rates are more prone to defaulter.
- Borrower with rent or mortgage home ownership are more prone to turning out to a defaulter. Lending club should avoid giving high loans to this category.
- Grade could be a good source to validate users. Lending club should be more clinical when issuing loan to a lower grade as lower the grade, higher the probability of turning out to be defaulter.
- Public bankruptcy record is also a good metric to analysis. Users with bankruptcy records are more prone to defaulter.
- Loans provided to small businesses, debt consolidation and credit card are more prone to defaulter. Lending club should investigate more for loan request for these purposes. They should also issue either less or deny such loan requests
- More loans were provided to not verified users and hence it has more count. However more defaulter % (proportion) is when the user’s verification status is verified.
- Loans provided to users from CA, NL, NY are more prone to defaulter
